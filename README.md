# wello_horld
A test repository to set up a "Hello world" webapp running in Docker inside an Ubuntu 16.04 Virtual Box managed with Vagrant version controlled with git.  You dog, I heard you were cold and that you like software layers, so we put software layers in your software layers, so you can write layered software while you're wearing soft layers
